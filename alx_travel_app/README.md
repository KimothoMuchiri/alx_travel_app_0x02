# alx_travel_app
The alxtravelapp project is a real-world Django application that serves as the foundation for a travel listing platform

Objective

Build API views to manage listings and bookings, and ensure the endpoints are documented with Swagger.

Instructions

## Create ViewSets:

In listings/views.py, create viewsets for Listing and Booking using Django REST frameworkâ€™s ModelViewSet.
Ensure that these views provide CRUD operations for both models.

## Configure URLs:

Use a router to configure URLs for the API endpoints.
Ensure endpoints follow RESTful conventions and are accessible under /api/.
## Test Endpoints:

Test each endpoint (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using a tool like Postman to ensure they work as expected.
